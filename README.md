# DataStructures
Hello everybody, This is a compilation of past projects that I have worked on. All of these projects were from my data structures
and algorithms class, specifically from San Jose State University. 
Each lab has a different structure
Lab 1 was used to understand the IDE which was CLion
Lab 2 was a string vector lab which was used mostly for other labs
Lab 3 was for First in First out and Last in First out algorithms 
Lab 4 was a calculator algorithm
Lab 5 was a singly linked list algorithm that included more calculator functions such as the % operator.
Lab 6 was a doubly linked list algorithm with a given node header file
Lab 7 was a binary search tree algorithm with another given node header file
Lab 8 was a hash table which had some given hashes.
